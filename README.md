# Will's Wallpapers

Also known as *will*-papers. Sorry, I'll show myself out.

My official repository for wallpapers and related scripts

## How to Use

First, run `make install` after cloning.
You'll also want to add `setbg` to your init scripts, for example in `.config/i3`.

Now you can:

- Run `setbg .` to choose a random wallpaper.
- Run `setbg <subdir>` to choose a random wallpaper in `<subdir>`.
- Run `setbg <subdir/path/to/image>` to choose a specific wallpaper in `<subdir>`.
- Run `setbg <absolute/path/to/image>` to choose any specific image, in any directory.
